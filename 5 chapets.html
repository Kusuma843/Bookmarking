                <p>The online food ordering system provides convenience for the customers. It overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional queuing system. This system increases the takeaway of foods than visitors. Therefore, this system enhances the speed and standardization of taking the order from the customer. It provides a better communication platform. the user’s details are noted electronically.
                    The online food ordering system set up menu online and the customers easily places the order with a simple mouse click. Also with a food menu online you can easily track the orders, maintain customer's database and improve your food delivery service. This system allows the user to select the desired food items from the displayed menu. The user orders the food items. The payment can be made online or pay-on-delivery system. The user’s details are maintained confidential because it maintains a separate account for each user. An id and password is provided for each user. Therefore it provides a more secured ordering.

     <p>Existing System
        In existing system for giving any orders users should visit hotels or restaurants to know about food items and them give order and pay advance.  In this method time and manual work is required. Maintaining critical information in the files and manuals is full of risk and a tedious process.
        Drawbacks
        1.	Its Manual Process so its not accurate and fast
        2.	Customers need to order food
        3.	Manually maintain the reports and sales
        Proposed System
        This online application enables the end users to register online, select the food from the e-menu card, read the E-menu card and order food online. By just selecting  the food that the user want to have. The results after selecting the food from the E-menu card will directly appear in the screen near the Chef who is going to cook the food for you. By using this application the work of the Waiter is reduced and we can also say that the work is nullified. The benefit of this is that if there is rush in the Restaurant then there will be chances that the waiters will be unavailable and the users can directly order the food to the chef online by using this application. The user will be given a username and a password to login.
          
        Advantages
        1.	Automated Business process- records management, payment transaction, and report generation is much easier and convenient to process
        2.	Records Management – it is a database system that makes the records electronic, safe, accurate, reliable, and fast.
        3.	Report Generation – the system automatically generates and provides real-time reports on the status of the inquired repair services.
        
        Modules
        Admin
        The person in this module has control over the entire system as he/she can add, delete anyone from the system. The admin can view the details of another person and can edit any details. The users from another module will send the request to admin for any change.
        Restorant
        Those who provides food , he can register and login into the system, He can check the orders and reviews.
        Customer
        Customer can order the food through this website. Customer need to register </p>

        <p>Process Model - WATERFALL MODEL
            Waterfall model indicates that all the SDLC steps will be going on step by step. In this model once one stage completed then only it will start the another process. This will be implemented when the requirements well known and clearly defined.
            In this model we can implement all the setps one by one. First we will do requirements gathering i.e in this step business analyst will collect the all functional requirements from the client and will discuss with the manager and development team. Second step is analysis where people can analyses the requirements so that they will do risk basement, risk mitigation, risk controlling steps. And also they will do the cost-time analysis to estimate the cost. They will also do the detail feasible study

            In third phase called design page generally people will design the project i.e represent will prepare the uml diagrams and prototypes for project. And then developers will start programing or coding based on design . Finally testing team will test the content to identify and fix the bugs. After successful user acceptance testing application will be deployed and maintained in the client machine.
            
            The waterfall model was selected as the SDLC model due to the following reasons:
            •	When the requirements are very clear and not changed.
            •	Available technology is enough to implement.
            •	Project is easy and simple to understand to finish.
            •	And if we don’t have any confusion in requirements.
            •	We can easily manage the review process and task management.
            •	Every stage defined clearly and with timelines
            
             
        a in to a usable form for processing can be achieved by inspecting the computer to read data from a written or printed document.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES
    1.Input Design is the process of converting a user-oriented description of the input into a computer-based system. This design is important to avoid errors in the data input process and show the correct direction to the management for getting correct information from the computerized system.
    2. It is achieved by creating user-friendly screens for the data entry to handle large volume of data. The goal of designing input is to make data entry easier and to be free from errors. The data entry screen is designed in such a way that all the data manipulates can be performed. It also provides record viewing facilities.
    3.When the data is entered it will check for its validity. Data can be entered with the help of screens. Appropriate messages are provided as when needed so that the user will not be in maize of instant. Thus the objective of input design is to create an input layout that is easy to follow

OUTPUT DESIGN
        A quality output is one, which meets the requirements of the end user and presents the information clearly. In any system results of processing are communicated to the users and to other system through outputs. In output design it is determined how the information is to be displaced for immediate need and also the hard copy output. It is the most important and direct source information to the user. Efficient and intelligent output design improves the system’s relationship to help user decision-making.
       1. Designing computer output should proceed in an organized, well thought out manner; the right output must be developed while ensuring that each output element is designed so that people will find the system can use easily and effectively. When analysis design computer output, they should Identify the specific output that is needed to meet the requirements.
      2.Select methods for presenting information.
       3.Create document, report, or other formats that contain information produced by the system.
       The output form of an information system should accomplish one or more of the following objectives.
•	Convey information about past activities, current status or projections of the
•	Future.
•	Signal important events, opportunities, problems, or warnings.
•	Trigger an action.
•	Confirm an action.
